### ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW :

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS :

  * What is the relation of environmental temperature to scallop size (Shell height)?
  * What is the relation of environmental temperature to various aspects of scallop? weight (meat weight, viscera weight, etc.)?
  * How gear types impact the growth of scallops?
  * How the closure impacts on the growth of scallops in the last five years?
  * The spat bags whether it is helping in the growth of scallops?
  * Temperature impacts on the scallops in spat bags or in cages?
  * Surface water temperature impacts on scallop growth?
  * Differences in growth rate of Male and Female scallops?

### MANAGEMENT ACTIONS :
Ocean acidification is one of the pertaining issues which can decline the number of scallops and other fisheries. 
The ocean absorbs the excess carbon dioxide from the air, it forms carbonic acid when air interacts with water, which leads to 
ocean acidification. It can impact both aquaculture and the other fisheries in the ocean.It has the potential to reduce the 
scallop biomass by approximately 13%. (Rheuban, 2018). One of the initiatives of growing kelp to increase the water quality and 
saving the scallops from the ocean acidification. The remedy proposed by the researchers is called phytoremediation, in which 
plants or other algaes absorbs the CO2 from the water. In Hurricane Island, the kelp like trees are used to reduce the CO2 level and
increase the oxygen from the water. (Caroline Albertson, 2019).

Ear hanging is one of the methods which is used to increase the growth rate of the scallops once they are 2 inches across. 
The technology is being adopted by the Japanese technique, in which a hole is drilled in the _ear_ of the scallop shell so that it can 
be tied to the rope so that they can grow out. The scallops are spaced several inches apart which help them to grow faster, 
probably twice as fast as normal. (Jennifer Page, 2016).

National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) reports the closure of the remaining 2019 fishing area for Limited Access General Category 
vessels of the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area. Guidelines require this activity once NMFS ventures that 100 percent 
of the Limited Access General Category complete suitable catch for the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area will be collected.
This activity is planned to avoid the overharvest of the 2019 complete passable catch assigned to the Limited Access General Category 
Fishery. (Federal Register, 2019)
