### ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW :

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS :

  * What is the relation of environmental temperature to scallop size (Shell height)?
  * What is the relation of environmental temperature to various aspects of scallop? weight (meat weight, viscera weight, etc.)?
  * How gear types impact the growth of scallops?
  * How the closure impacts on the growth of scallops in the last five years?
  * The spat bags whether it is helping in the growth of scallops?
  * Temperature impacts on the scallops in spat bags or in cages?
  * Surface water temperature impacts on scallop growth?
  * Differences in growth rate of Male and Female scallops?


### ORGANISM STUDY :

Scallops are cosmopolitan family of bivalves. The study organism here is the Giant sea scallop or Placopecten magellanicus which is of the family Pectinidae and order Ostreoida. The life cycle of scallop is depicted in the below figure. Scallops produce gametes starting in the first or second year and produce up to 270 million eggs. The first two larval stages are trochophore and veliger. It was observed that veligers were able to detect small temperature gradients and also react. The larvae develop the shell, eye spots and foot at this stage. The duration of the larval stages is observed to be shorter at a higher temperature and with plenty of food.

After this stage, larvae develop foot and byssus gland that secretes threads that are used to attach to hard surfaces and this stage is the pediveliger stage. Spat bags are used in harvesting scallops at this stage of their life. Spat mesh bags are not selective and collecting any floating larvae which could include anything from scallops to muscles to clams. The Spat bags are shown in the picture below. Each bag could collect upwards 500 scallops along with other species.

The sexes in the sea scallops are separate unlike some members of scallop family which are simultaneous hermaphrodites where both sexes in the same individual, and a few are protandrous hermaphrodites where males when young then switching to female.  Gender in sea scallops can be identified by the color of gonads as red for females and white for males.  

##### Growth
 
Offshore scallops feed on phytoplankton and resuspended organic material. Phytoplankton appears necessary to meet scallop energetic demands, although seaweed detritus may be an important food supplement in nearshore environments. A study by Pilditch and Grant indicated that food concentration plays an important role than temperature in controlling growth rates for 2-year old scallops. Along with temperate and food other characteristics of a habitat that effect scallop growth are salinity, currents and prey.  
 


### MANAGEMENT ACTIONS :
Ocean acidification is one of the pertaining issues which can decline the number of scallops and other fisheries. 
The ocean absorbs the excess carbon dioxide from the air, it forms carbonic acid when air interacts with water, which leads to 
ocean acidification. It can impact both aquaculture and the other fisheries in the ocean.It has the potential to reduce the 
scallop biomass by approximately 13%. (Rheuban, 2018). One of the initiatives of growing kelp to increase the water quality and 
saving the scallops from the ocean acidification. The remedy proposed by the researchers is called phytoremediation, in which 
plants or other algaes absorbs the CO2 from the water. In Hurricane Island, the kelp like trees are used to reduce the CO2 level and
increase the oxygen from the water. (Caroline Albertson, 2019).

Ear hanging is one of the methods which is used to increase the growth rate of the scallops once they are 2 inches across. 
The technology is being adopted by the Japanese technique, in which a hole is drilled in the _ear_ of the scallop shell so that it can 
be tied to the rope so that they can grow out. The scallops are spaced several inches apart which help them to grow faster, 
probably twice as fast as normal. (Jennifer Page, 2016).

National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) reports the closure of the remaining 2019 fishing area for Limited Access General Category 
vessels of the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area. Guidelines require this activity once NMFS ventures that 100 percent 
of the Limited Access General Category complete suitable catch for the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area will be collected.
This activity is planned to avoid the overharvest of the 2019 complete passable catch assigned to the Limited Access General Category 
Fishery. (Federal Register, 2019)
