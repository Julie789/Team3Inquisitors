### ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW :

Our clients for this project are from the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership, located in Penobscot Bay, Maine. This is a non-profit organization that performs research surrounding the marine life, ecology, etc. of the titular island and its surroundings as well as provide opportunities for education and research for everyone from middle school students to seasoned researchers, to fishermen. Their mission is to integrate science education, applied research, and leadership development through year-round educational programs and a seasonal, environmentally-sustainable island community. (About, 2019). They have been in operation since 2009 and have performed extensive work in helping and promoting sustainable living technology, STEM research, and hands-on education. Their representative of the project that explained the gist of the project was Phoebe Jekielek, who has worked in marine science for various institutions after completing her studies. She has completed her under graduation in Biology in 2003 and later did her Master’s degree in Marine Science and Marine Policy.

The project in question that we are focusing on is the Midcoast Main Collaborative Scallop Project which started in 2013 on Lower Muscle Ridge south of Spruce Head in western Penobscot Bay. This project’s main focus is to study scallop growth and populations in closed areas surrounding the research center. The center partners the project with multiple organizations which includes: the Maine Department of Marine Resources, Island Institute, the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Penobscot East Resource Center, and the University of Maine. The project’s objectives are:

1.	“To assess the effectiveness of the small-scale closed area in rebuilding resident scallop populations (i.e. does the scallop population inside the closed area and in the adjacent control areas change over the three year period?) and”
2.	“To develop a collaborative project approach and monitoring protocol that can be replicated elsewhere along the coast.”

(Science and Research, 2019).

So not only are they performing research for the sake of collecting information about their local populations, but intend to have their research and surveying methodologies serve as a template for other areas to perform similar research.

### ORGANISM STUDY :

Scallops are cosmopolitan family of bivalves. The study organism here is the Giant sea scallop or Placopecten magellanicus which is of the family Pectinidae and order Ostreoida. The life cycle of scallop is depicted in the below figure. Scallops produce gametes starting in the first or second year and produce up to 270 million eggs. The first two larval stages are trochophore and veliger. It was observed that veligers were able to detect small temperature gradients and also react. The larvae develop the shell, eye spots and foot at this stage. The duration of the larval stages is observed to be shorter at a higher temperature and with plenty of food. (Hart, D., & Chute, A. S. (2004).)

After this stage, larvae develop foot and byssus gland that secretes threads that are used to attach to hard surfaces and this stage is the pediveliger stage. Spat bags are used in harvesting scallops at this stage of their life. Spat mesh bags are not selective and collecting any floating larvae which could include anything from scallops to muscles to clams. The Spat bags are shown in the picture below. Each bag could collect upwards 500 scallops along with other species. (Hart, D., & Chute, A. S. (2004).)

The sexes in the sea scallops are separate unlike some members of scallop family which are simultaneous hermaphrodites where both sexes in the same individual, and a few are protandrous hermaphrodites where males when young then switching to female.  Gender in sea scallops can be identified by the color of gonads as red for females and white for males. (Hart, D., & Chute, A. S. (2004).)  

##### Growth
 
Offshore scallops feed on phytoplankton and suspended organic material. Phytoplankton appears necessary to meet scallop energetic demands, although seaweed detritus may be an important food supplement in nearshore environments. A study by Pilditch and Grant indicated that food concentration plays an important role than temperature in controlling growth rates for 2-year old scallops. Along with temperate and food other characteristics of a habitat that effect scallop growth are salinity, currents and prey. (Hart, D., & Chute, A. S. (2004).)  

A research recognized four main regions of concern to know future effects on sea scallops:
  1) Ocean acidification
  2) future climate scenario that includes economic development
  3) fishery management scenarios
  4) future fuel costs. 
  
(Rheuban JE, Doney SC, Cooley SR, Hart DR (2018)) 

The small effects of enhanced CO2 concentrations would be a decrease in larval survival, and elevated effects would result in a decrease in shell density, placing the scallops at risk with predators. The second region of concern is the economic development that would affect the pricing of scallops. Increasing fuel expenses could result in up to 80% of the working expenses of the scallop ship. (Rheuban JE, Doney SC, Cooley SR, Hart DR (2018))
 
The process where increased amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration reduces ocean pH and calcium carbonate saturation state is called ocean acidification. This method has adverse effects throughout the globe on aquaculture. Their life-cycle of multiple stages is considerably affected. Many species also showed a higher rate of larval mortality in survived larvae. The IAM forecasts fishing yields and financial advantages under future circumstances based on financial viability and inventory biomass, and the model is shown below. Red arrows indicate sub-model associations, black arrows indicate sub-model population, green arrows show decision-making and sub-model socio-economic.

### MANAGEMENT ACTIONS :

The management of Hurricane is always attempting to discover methods of being more sustainable. It is important for the living beings in the ocean. One of the initiatives of growing kelp to increase the water quality and saving the scallops from the ocean acidification. The remedy proposed by the researchers is called phytoremediation, in which plants or other algae’s absorbs the CO2 from the water. In Hurricane Island, the kelp like trees are used to reduce the CO2 level and increase the oxygen from the water. During summer, the team were continuously testing the water sample to check if kelp has any effect on the oceans. (Caroline Albertson, 2019).

Ocean acidification is one of the pertaining issues which can decline the number of scallops and other fisheries. The main reason for the acidification of the ocean is the increase of the carbon dioxide content in the air due to various factors, majorly, burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas from the industries. The ocean absorbs the excess carbon dioxide from the air, it forms carbonic acid when air interacts with water, which leads to ocean acidification. It can impact both aquaculture and the other fisheries in the ocean. It has the potential to reduce the scallop biomass by approximately 13%. (Rheuban, 2018).

The other major adoption by the Hurricane management is the adoption of ear hanging for the scallops. The Food and Agriculture Research Foundation (FFAR), a U.S. non-profit organization set up in the 2014 Farm Bill, has given a grant of USD 300,000 (EUR) to pioneer fresh scallop manufacturing methods in Maine. The project's aim is to explore the financial viability of the Maine scallop manufacturing method in Japanese "ear-hanging." The grant, which will finance a three-year program, will cover the assessment of the industry and will hire a consultant with wild scallop background. To make scallop farming profitable, they are investing more on the machinery to save on labor. (Chris L, 2018).

Ear hanging is one of the techniques used to boost the scallops ' development rate once they reach 2 inches. The technology is being adopted by the Japanese technique, in which a hole is drilled in the ear of the scallop shell so that it can be tied to the rope so that they can grow out. The scallops are spaced several inches apart which help them to grow faster, probably twice as fast as normal. The scientists found out that the growth rate increases due to the unrestricted water flow and space, though the process is labor-intensive. In hurricane, they are using bottom cages now, but can consider the new process in future. (Jennifer Page, 2016).

National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) claims that the remaining 2019 fishing zone for the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area Limited Access General Category ships has been closed. Guidelines require this activity once NMFS ventures that 100 percent of the Limited Access General Category complete suitable catch for the Northern Gulf of Maine Scallop Management Area will be collected. This activity is planned to avoid the overharvest of the 2019 complete passable catch assigned to the Limited Access General Category Fishery. (Federal Register, 2019).
