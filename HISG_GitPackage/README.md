### HURRICANE ISLAND SCALLOP GROWTH 
###### DATA ANALYSIS BY TEAM:
###### THE INQUISITORS (Connor McCoy, Julie Sunny Mathew, Swetha Sindhuja Byluppala)

### ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW :

Our clients for this project are from the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership, located in Penobscot Bay, Maine. This is a non-profit organization that performs research surrounding the marine life, ecology, etc. of the titular island and its surroundings as well as provide opportunities for education and research for everyone from middle school students to seasoned researchers, to fishermen.The project in question that we are focusing on is the Midcoast Main Collaborative Scallop Project which started in 2013 on Lower Muscle Ridge south of Spruce Head in western Penobscot Bay. This projectâ€™s main focus is to study scallop growth and populations in closed areas surrounding the research center. 

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS :

The primary focus of our analysis is on the following research questions:

1. Differences in growth rate of Male and Female scallops?
2. How gear types impact the growth of scallops?
3. How does temperature differ between surface of the net and bottom of Cage?
4. Temperature gradients over 2 years? 
5. How does temperature and Light intensity levels vary at surface of the Net and Bottom of the Net?
6. What is the relation of environmental temperature and gear types to the weights of scallop? (meat weight, viscera weight, etc.)?
