Their mission is to combine science education, scientific research and development of leadership through year-round educational programs and a seasonal, sustainable island culture.  (About, 2019)

### Needs  
The project, “Midcoast Maine Collaborative Scallop Project” is to study the growth of Atlantic Sea Scallop (Placopecten Magellanicus) inside the closed area and in nearby areas. The project objectives are: 

1. “To assess the effectiveness of the small-scale closed area in rebuilding resident scallop populations (i.e. does the scallop population inside the closed area and in the adjacent control areas change over the three year period?) and”
2. “To develop a collaborative project approach and monitoring protocol that can be replicated elsewhere along the coast.”
