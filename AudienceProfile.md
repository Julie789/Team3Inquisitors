# Audience Profile  

## Name  
* Midcoast Main Collaborative Scallop Project  
* Represented by: Phoebe Jekilek  

## Sociodemographics  
### Training & Education
* B.A. in Biology - Boston University
* Duel Masters in Marine Science and Marine Biology
* Worked as Marine Science Instructor, Aquarist, and Assistant Program Director for the Catalina Island Marine Institute. (Program and Research Director, 2019)

### Technical Skills
* Classification of Scallops based on breeds, Species, and other physiological characteristics.
* Usage of live temperature and light measuring characteristics. 
* Usage of Microsoft Excel, MySQL, R Studio, and similar data analysis tools.

## Goals  
### Business/Organization Values/Mission  
Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership is a non profit organization which is located in Penobscot Bay, Maine. They have been in operation since 2009 and have performed extensive work in helping and promoting sustainable living technology, STEM research, and hands-on education.  (About, 2019)  

Their goal is to excite people about doing science and about being leaders in the next wave of scientific discovery and environmental conservation.  (About, 2019)  

Their mission is to combine science education, scientific research and development of leadership through year-round educational programs and a seasonal, sustainable island culture.  (About, 2019)  

### Needs  
The project, “Midcoast Maine Collaborative Scallop Project” is to study the growth of Atlantic Sea Scallop (Placopecten Magellanicus) inside the closed area and in nearby areas. The project objectives are: 

1. “To assess the effectiveness of the small-scale closed area in rebuilding resident scallop populations (i.e. does the scallop population inside the closed area and in the adjacent control areas change over the three year period?) and”
2. “To develop a collaborative project approach and monitoring protocol that can be replicated elsewhere along the coast.”

(Science and Research, 2019).

## Communities/target markets  
The Hurricane Island foundation is a non-profit organization working towards developing a centre for Science and Leadership and their Field Research Station. Their programs also focus on the same for students, scientists and volunteers. Their research includes providing opportunities to students, scientists as well as fishermen to work with professionals doing research in lobster biology, climate change and ocean monitoring.(Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership.)

## Ability to act (on recommendations) 
Considering that the foundation’s main focus is research and level of technical skills in leadership, recommendations will be well scrutinized. There is a high probability of implementing filtered recommendations.

## Challenges   
Hurricane Island is completely off the grid due to its remote location. One of the challenges they face is resource management. They make an effort to make a sustainable living  on the island and to be carbon neutral in the operations and activities of island community like water treatment and vegetable gardens.(Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership.)

## Organizational culture  
* Organizational culture is centered around public education from their citizen science programs to the research involvement with students from Undergraduates to Graduate education.
* Focuses on minimal carbon footprint and using eco-friendly means of power and utilities in the islands facilities.

## Past achievements  
* Received UL Innovation Education Awards in 2017.(Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership.)
* In the view of providing education and student involvement, many successful programs were run such as Youth & Family, School year, adult programs and teacher PD. (Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership.)
* Numerous research opportunities were provided for school, undergraduate and graduate students.(Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership.)
