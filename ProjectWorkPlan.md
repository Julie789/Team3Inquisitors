### HURRICANE ISLAND SCALLOP GROWTH 
# PROJECT WORKPLAN
###### BY TEAM:
###### THE INQUISTORS (Connor McCoy, Julie Sunny Mathew, Swetha Sindhuja Byluppala)

### INTRODUCTION :  
We, Team Inquisitor, will be working on analysis on the data collected from Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership regarding certain species of scallops. The research data was collected from closed off, controlled sections of scallop populations in different locations with different water and environmental conditions. These different conditions include things such as water density and temperature along with size measurements that were taken of the Scallops over time in these areas. We will be looking to find correlations, or lack thereof, of the environmental conditions and the growth rates of the scallops. Our project has been broken up into a multi-step process consisting of research, data cleaning, data analysis, and compilation.


### PROJECT TASKS AND TIMELINE :  
These are the main milestones for the group project. Each have a high level description of the task at hand as well as a breakdown of the different elements that will be handled by the different members of the group. Generally, we are going for the approach of one task for each member, along with one group task that will in some way involve all the work we’d individually into a coherent whole. While matters such as interviews will be conducted as a group, we each will be doing slightly different research based on our initial proposed research questions, which will dictate the jobs we do for the rest of the semester.

* **_BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND RQS_**  
    Here we will focus on getting base knowledge and information about our subject matter and the stakeholders themselves in order to determine how best to approach understanding their data and the implications of it. As per the requirements of the assignment we will at minimum cover the following:  
    * The client’s organization and its mission and goals - Connor
    * The research questions you plan to focus on and why they matter - C, S, J
    * The study organism or phenomenon - Swetha  
    * The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support (e.g., management actions, advocacy for policy changes, etc.) - Juli
* **_AUDIENCE PROFILE_**  
Procure contacts and schedule interviews with the stakeholders and create profiles based on our templates. This will be an activity conducted by all members of the group together. We will interview them at the same time, while individually creating profiles that we will later compile into the final official profile that we will utilize from that point onwards in the project.  
* **_DATA CLEANING DOCUMENTATION_**  
The dividing out of this workload among the group will be decided once the direction and scope of the project is made more clear to us based on the information we will learn down the road. Roles for this assignment will be divided based on the different aspects of the project, roughly breaking down to the following:  
    * Describing the dataset schema, including the metadata
    * Explain problems we have encountered regarding the dataset
    * How we plan to fix these issues, documented in a replicable form  

* **_PROGRESS MEETING_**
* **_R SCRIPT_**
* **_R PLOTS_**
* **_GIT REPOSITORY PACKAGE_**  
This activity involves making sure that the required documents are all uploaded to the Git repository. the required documents are  
    + Readme.md
    + HTML document with R scripts and R Plots
    + Analysis and plotting script in R
    + Audience Profile
    + A summary report
    + Presentation slides

* **_PROJECT PRESENTATION_**  
A final presentation of the complete project has to presented. This presentation addresses the following points
    + Why the questions are important
    + Who should care
    + Where the data comes from
    + How you use it
    + The limitations of the data
    + Interpretation of the data
    + What decesions should be made based on your analysis

### ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES : 
* **_PROOF READER_**
* **_DOCUMENTATION LEAD_**  
        Documentation Lead is responsible for all the required documents in the project. She makes sure that appropriate documents are created, updated, shared with the client and submitted in Canvas.
* **_TECHNICAL LEAD_**
* **_CLIENT REPRESENTATIVE_**

### CONTRIBUTION STATEMENT : 
The Background researchand RQs include below questions and the contribution is also mentioned below.
* The client's organization and its mission and goals - Connor McCoy will be contributing in understanding the organization.
* The research questions we plan to focus on and why they matter - Equal contribution from Connor McCoy, Julie Sunny and Swetha Byluppala.  
* The study organism or phenomenon - Swetha Byluppala will contribute in understanding the study organism which is Scallops.
* The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support (e.g., management actions, advocacy for policy changes, etc.) - Julie Sunny will contribute in listing out possible outcomes that the analysis results could support.

### COMMUNICATION AGREEMENT : 
In the interest of ensuring continous flow of information and transparency, the team adheres to the following procedures.
* All the meetings will be scheduled at least 24 hours prior to the meeting time.
* Meetings could be either in-person or through Zoom.
* Major communication will be via e-mail to the following e-mail ids  
    + sbyluppala@unomaha.edu  
    + jsunnymathew@unomaha.edu
    + cjmccoy@unomaha.edu
* Meeting notes will be shared after every meeting with the Client.
* Google Drive will be used to collaborate on documents among the team.
* Final documents will be submitted on Canvas.
